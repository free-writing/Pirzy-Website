# *Clean Coder &Code Smells Fighter! ðŸ¥Š*

Iâ€™m Pierre-Henry. A cool Software Engineer ! I created [pH7CMS](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS) a while ago and also work on some other exciting [open source projects](https://github.com/pH-7) ðŸ˜Š

I love programming and developing new skills with pro-activity, rigorously and methodically.

Passion for writing secure, testable and scalable applications with clean and maintainable code.
High test coverage (TDD/BDD as well!) are very important to me. Enjoy solving problems and fixing (complex) issues/bugs.

Always want to do my best with best practices and Clean Code! Love also the business world, growth hacking, Web Marketing (but not the old-school one!) and Psychology!

Always thirsty to learn and undertake new exciting things and thrilling challenges.

Extremely passionate and motivated in what Iâ€™m doing.
I always want to push a lot of energy, determination, focus and knowledge from myself in order to accomplish as best as I can a new project or mission from scratch ! ðŸš€

I like productivity too such as 80/20 rule and Parkinsonâ€™s law in order to do more, faster and always better.
Open-minded, team player and honest, always want to share knowledge and help the others.
